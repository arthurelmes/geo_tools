This is IDL code, so you must have IDL set up previously.
The code can be run like:

idl -e "readgroundmeasurement_surfrad"

Make sure you have at least to *.pro files: calaveragep.pro and readgroundmeasurement_surfrad.pro

The data must be organized like:

../table_mnt/[all the .dat files for the site]

You must match the directory name containing all the .dat files with the name inside the readgroundmeasurement_surfrad.pro script.
